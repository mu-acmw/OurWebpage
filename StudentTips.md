# Tips For CSE Students
This is intended for students of all stages in the CSE department at Miami University. These tips and learnings have been collected from current ACM-W members as well as past members who have gone on to work at Amazon, Reddit, IBM, Target, and more. Much of it is information we wish we knew when we were in your shoes.

You're awesome. Hopefully these words will help you down the road.

# Life at Miami

**Join clubs, meet new people.**

The CSE department/engineering school have many great organizations (like ACM-W) but it's important to have interests in other areas as well to become more well-rounded.

**Get to know your professors.**

Go to their office hours, ask questions, get to know them. They're human beings too and they're invested in you.

# Tips by Year 

## First Year

**Carrer Fair** 

Go! Chances are you're not ready for an internship but these can be pretty nerve-racking. Check it out when an internship isn't quite on the line yet so you know what to expect in the coming years. Talk to recruiters and learn about the opportunities they have (they get bored standing there for hours if no one comes).

**Scheduling Classes** 

Find the CRN for courses [here](https://www.apps.miamioh.edu/courselist/) and punch those into BannerWeb instead of searching for each one. Then register for all your couses in one click.

**Miami Plan Courses** 

If you have the option, take it online. They tend to be _slightly_ easier and you'll save the time normally needed to walk to class.

**Filling Out That Empty Resume**

It's hard to make a resume your first year. Here are some great things you can pursue and then add to your resume.

* Relevent CSE courses
* Leadership positions in clubs
* Personal projects (like a personal website)
* Languages you know (Java!)

**First Year Internship Programs**

There are many companies that have summer programs specifically for first years in Computing majors (it will say it's for first years). [It's an easy google search away](https://www.google.com/search?ei=dUHvWqmGMKmkjwT01oHIDA&q=first+year+computer+science+internships&oq=first+year+computer+science+in&gs_l=psy-ab.1.0.0j0i22i30k1l6.131298.142694.0.144954.58.37.11.6.6.0.315.4329.1j21j5j1.28.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..18.40.3586...46j0i67k1j0i131k1j0i46k1j33i22i29i30k1.0.BJcDAAG16qU) and here are some we know about:

## Second Year

**[Grace Hopper Conference](https://ghc.anitab.org/)** 

The world's largest gathering of women technologists and an incredible week of fun. Apply for scholarships to attend in the Spring- they will cover all expenses including travel and food. Scholarships are offered by the conference itself, various tech companies (Google, FB, Twitter, etc.) and you can also talk to the department about sponsorship as well. 

**Hackathons** 

Grab some friends and attend! Major League Hacking is the official student hackathon league and has events all over the country almost every weekend. Look for some [here](https://mlh.io/).

**Second-Year Programs**

Some of the opportunities listed in the [First Year section above](#first-year) are also open to second years (Microsoft Explorer is). There are also a variety of STEM outreach programs specifically for second years listed below. Most of these are a weekend in the beginning of summer and can be done before an internship. Great opportunity to learn about another company and meet other incredible women in computing. 

* Target Diversity Leadership Symposium
* [MongoDB Women in CS Summit](https://www.mongodb.com/women-in-cs-summit)
